Noémie Jaquier is a WASP-affiliated Assistant Professor at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. She is the head of the Geometric Robot Learning (GeoRob) Lab in the Division of Robotics, Perception, and Learning. Previously, she was a postdoctoral researcher in the  High Performance Humanoid Technologies Lab (H²T) at KIT and a visiting postdoctoral scholar at the Stanford Robotics Lab. She received her PhD from EPFL in 2020 and did a PhD sabbatical at the Bosch Center for AI during this time. In her research, she leverages differential geometry and physics-based inductive bias to develop data-efficient robot learning, optimization, and control algorithms with sound theoretical guarantees.
