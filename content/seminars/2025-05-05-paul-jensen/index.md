The microbiome revolution has identified thousands of species of bacteria that deserve scientific investigation. Scientists cannot keep pace with the expanding tree of life, and most species of bacteria remain unstudied. AI and automation could accelerate scientific discovery by replacing humans with algorithms that mine the scientific literature and design new experiments. The least-studied bacteria would benefit the most from automated research, but, ironically, the lack of data makes it difficult to deploy autonomous agents to study these species. We present an automated science platform that maps microbial metabolism but requires no prior knowledge. Our AI agent -- called BacterAI -- learns by converting scientific questions into simple games that it plays with laboratory robots. The agent then distills its findings into logical rules that can be interpreted by human scientists. In less than two weeks, our system went from knowing nothing about a bacterium to communicating novel findings to another scientist.
