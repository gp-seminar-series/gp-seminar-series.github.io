# About

Founded in 2022, the *Virtual Seminar Series on Bayesian Decision-making and Uncertainty* is dedicated to bringing scientists together to learn about the latest developments in probabilistic machine learning and related research areas, with a mailing list of approximately 700 subscribers as of early 2025.
Prior to 2024, the seminar series was known as the *Virtual Seminar Series on Gaussian Processes, Spatiotemporal Modeling, and Decision-making Systems*.
In addition to virtual seminars, the seminar series has also led to the organizing of two [machine learning workshops](/workshops/), which in 2024 attracted a total of 350 participants at its poster session.
Join our [mailing list](/instructions/) to learn more about virtual seminars and other upcoming events!
