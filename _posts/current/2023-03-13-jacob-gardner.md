Jacob R. Gardner is an assistant professor in the Computer and Information Science department at the University of Pennsylvania. He does research in machine learning, with a focus scalable probabilistic machine learning methods and Bayesian machine learning. 
Recently, he's been interested in how machine learning techniques can be applied to large-scale, high dimensional optimization problems in the natural sciences. 
In 2022, he received an NSF CAREER award funding work on these kinds of optimization problems.
