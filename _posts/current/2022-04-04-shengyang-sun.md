title: Structured Inter-domain Inducing Points for Variational Gaussian Processes
highlight: true
---

Sparse variational Gaussian processes adopt inducing points to overcome the computational roadblocks in GP inferences. While standard inducing points are placed within the input domain, inter-domain inducing points enable vast flexibilities by considering the feature domain. In this talk, I will first talk about how we can employ discrete Fourier transform to design structured inter-domain inducing points and achieve substantial computational savings for GP inferences. We demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a high-fidelity variational GP approximation while retaining general applicability. Secondly, I will talk about an interpretation of neural network activations as inter-domain inducing points, which establishes an equivalence between finite-width neural networks and variational Gaussian processes.
